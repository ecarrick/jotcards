# jotcards
This project was the submission for the JotForm programming competition fall of 2013.

The main purpose of the submission was to stand as a proof of concept for the ability to use the JotForm API as a datasource and data storage mechanism.

The project creates a form, and the data for the flash cards are stored as form submissions through the API.
